These are scripts used to analyze the output of orthoMCL. The goal is to annotate each cluster, identify unique clusters
in each genome/group, and generate alignments and trees.

The main requirements are Python 2.7 (or higher, but not Python 3), and two libraries:
- PyCogent http://pycogent.org
- Biopython http://biopython.org

In addition, to run the alignment and tree script, muscle and Fasttree need to be installed and accessible globally

Coming soon: A how to guide for the analysis of genomes.
